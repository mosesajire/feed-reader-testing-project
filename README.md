## Documentation for the Feed Reader Testing Project

Hello there! Welcome to the repository of my Feed Reader Testing Project. Testing is an important part of application development process which is practised by many organizations via a standard known as 'Test-Driven Development (TDD)'. This ensures that developers write tests first, before developing their application.

# HOW TO GET STARTED
- To begin, you need to download the repository to your computer.
- Extract the downloaded file.
